# The Process behind Scruffing
Initially just a simple concept, the way it is implemented posed many questions and demanded a lot of design decisions, regarding the interaction between the player and itself. For example, where should the minimap be placed or mounted? Will it be full scale? What should be the scale? Will in the interaction in the minimap be limited to the player? And how can it be made suitable for any kind of distances?
These questions have partially been answered in a prototyping process. This culminated in a simple prototype, where all scene elements and the player are copied, yet remain linked to their original, but get scaled down and attached to the players left hand. Now whenever the player faces their left palm the map get's displayed and the mini-figure can be displaced.
A few further prototypes have been tried, but abandoned due to time-constraints, including scaling features and setting the location and mounting of the minimap.
A simple adaptation of the manipulation task has also been incorporated into this design as for some parts the manipulation object or target is attached to the minimap.
