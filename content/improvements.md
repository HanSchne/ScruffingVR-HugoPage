## Scalable Map
A solution to the short range accuracy problem would be to allow the map to scale, either by player input directly or indirectly. This could be done by injecting certain hand grab interactions to the base of the map or by having the scale change dynamically by for example the height of the miniplayer above the map. This would entail further adjustments, as the scaled minimap may take up the entire field of view afterwards, requiring the map to be centered on the miniplayer and for it to be a cut-out version of the original scale.
## Movable Map
The map as is is fixed to the players left palm. It may however be desirable to change between the left or right or have the map somewhere else all-together, such as right in front in the field of view. This would impose a set of new challenges like changing the ownership of an object, having varying methods of making the map disappear to not always be occluding the players view and more.
## Map-ception
Less useful but more fun, would also be to have an inception of scaled up and tiny versions "above" the player or even inside the tiny representation of the player. This can well be accompanied by an inverse-kinematics controlled body for the player that reaches down to pick one up, while the player as fishing for their tiny version simultaneously.
