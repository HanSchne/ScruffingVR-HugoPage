The result is a functional yet imperfect prototype, that offers a glimpse into the potential of this locomotion-technique. It is possible to complete the entire parcour with this technique, however it is very imprecise for short distances, required to clear some of the tasks, particularly reaching and executing the manipulation tasks. If it is the only locomotion technique used, then it is advised to have at least a roomscale-setup to be able to walk the last meter. It should be noted that, this technique requires specific inputs to be activated and thus may workvery well in tandem with other locomotion techniques, which are effective at short ranges.
For long ranges however, this style of movement really shines, as the entire map can be transversed in less than a second with a relatively high degree of precision, being able to circumvent almost any obstacle, as long as a point is visible on the minimap!
