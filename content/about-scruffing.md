# About Scruffing
Scruffing describes the method of cats picking kittens up by the neck to carry them around. I used this and also the little yellow guy from google maps to device a new method of locomotion for Virtual Reality. In this method the player can pick up a miniature version of themself and move it around in a miniature environment, which then translates to movement of themselves in the real environment. It is bootstrapping by it's textbook definition and a strange, yet intuitive way to travel medium to long distances in VR.
